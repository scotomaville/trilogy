## What This Repository Is

This is the complete, open-source home for the **Leaving Scotomaville** trilogy — a 462-page interactive guidebook, built over five years and three cross-country bicycle expeditions during the heart of the COVID pandemic.

It is **not** just a book.  
It is a filmed, raw, real-time demonstration of one human being climbing out of psychological blind spots (“scotomas”), false beliefs, emotional traps, and gut-brain chaos — using nothing more than a smartphone, brutal honesty, and a question: **Why do I do what I do?**

Every insight is backed by **onus probandi** — QR codes that link directly to unedited video footage from the road. You can watch the setbacks, the breakdowns, the breakthroughs, exactly as they happened.

This work is the proven foundation that later gave birth to the **Initium Principia Gnosis** framework, the card deck, the game, and the MA5 Council Charter.

## Why It Matters

Most self-help books tell you what to think.  
Scotomaville **shows** you how one person rewired a 20-watt brain in real time — and invites you to do the same.

- It was created **before** widespread public access to powerful AI.
- Yet it already models the exact collaboration humans will need with super-reasoning engines.
- It proves that “Know Thyself” is no longer optional — it’s survival in an age where algorithms target our biology faster than we can reason.

When the entire corpus was fed to ChatGPT in 2023, it summarized five years of work in one word: **monomyth**.  
That single word sparked the building of a salt cave, five months of deep listening, and the creation of Initium.

This is the living proof that transformation is possible — for humans **and** for the AI that will inherit our wisdom.
